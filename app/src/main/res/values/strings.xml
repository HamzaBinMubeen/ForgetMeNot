    <string name="article_exercise_paragraph_1">In the exercise, you should answer questions. For
        each deck, you can specify unique settings, which can significantly change the examination

        \n\n\t- is there a time limit for response
        (<annotation clickable="motivational_timer">Motivational timer</annotation>)

        \n\nRegardless of <annotation clickable="testing_method">testing method</annotation>,
        the answer may be either correct or wrong. If the answer is wrong, the card will be asked
        again until the answer is correct. It is needed in order to make sure that you commit the

        the grade determines when the card will be asked again.

        \n\nIf you know the question well and you don\'t want this card ever to be asked again or
        you don\'t want to study the card, click the \'Do not ask again\' icon. This card will be
        marked as learned.</string>

    <string name="article_exercise_paragraph_3">You can edit the card just in the exercise. It
        might be needed not only for correcting mistakes on the card, but also for improving the
        card if it is difficult to remember. You may also use search if you confused answers.

        \n\nThere are two types of hints available in the exercise:

        \n\n\t- \'Get variants\'. Four variants will be provided to choose. The variants are taken
        from the deck to which the card belongs. This hint can make it a lot easier to answer if the
        deck is not designed for \'Testing method with variants\'.
        \n\n\t- \'Mask letters\'. This hint can be applied many times. The first time you turn to
        the hint, all letters will be replaced with a masked character ■. You can see how many
        words are in the answer, how many letters are in each word. If this is not enough, you can
        unmask part of the answer. Just select a fragment and press \'Unmask selected region\' on
        hint popup window.</string>
    <string name="article_exercise_paragraph_4">You can also do the exercise without looking at the
        screen in <annotation clickable="walking_mode">\'Walking mode\'</annotation>.</string>
    <string name="article_testing_methods_paragraph_1">Testing methods define how the answer will
        be tested. There are 4 options:</string>
    <string name="article_testing_methods_off_section_title">1. Without testing</string>
    <string name="question_example_off_testing_method">Всі діти в цьому класі дуже ввічливі.</string>

    <string name="article_testing_methods_off_section_description">It may be used for decks with
        which you do not plan to work for a long time. For example, it might be a deck that contains
        sentences in the native and target language and you want to translate once without further
        repetition.</string>

    <string name="article_testing_methods_quiz_section_description">In this mode, you need to choose
        the correct variant from the four offered. Variants are taken from the deck to which the
        card belongs. Therefore, if you are going to use this testing method, it is important to
        create a deck where variants are appropriate. For example, it could be a
        \'word-translation\' deck with the same parts of speech. This is a more playful form of
        testing, so it\'s great for kids. The disadvantage is the average memory efficiency, as
        variants are an significant clue.</string>
    <string name="article_testing_methods_entry_section_title">4. Spell check</string>
    <string name="question_example_entry_testing_method">Past participle form of \'bring\'</string>
    <string name="answer_example_entry_testing_method">brought</string>
    <string name="article_testing_methods_entry_section_description">This method will be useful if
        you want to test the spelling of words. It can be used as a dictation. To do this, create a
        deck where the question and answer will be the same, turn off the question display, select
        the language and enable the auto-pronunciation of the question in the deck settings.</string>
    <string name="article_grade_and_intervals_paragraph1">Each card is characterized by the grade.
        Each answer in the exercise affects the grade in the following way:

        \n\n\t- decreases by one for each wrong answer, but not less than zero

        \n\n\t- increases by one with the correct answer, but only if the card is answered for the
        first time in this exercise session

        \n\n\t- does not change if the answer is correct, but this card was sent for retesting,
        due to an incorrect answer the previous time</string>
    <string name="question_in_grade_and_intervals_article">цинк</string>
    <string name="answer_in_grade_and_intervals_article">zinc</string>
    <string name="article_grade_and_intervals_paragraph2">The grade is directly related to
        intervals, which are applied to the deck. The intervals affect when the card is available
        for the exercise next time after responding. Usually, the higher the grade, the longer the
        interval. That is, the intervals are needed so that you deal more with poorly-studied cards
        and less with well-studied ones.

        \n\nPerhaps, for some reason, you want to change the grade. Just tap on the \'Grade\' icon
        and choose the one you want. Usually, when you change the grade, you would like to clarify
        how long it will take to be this card questioned again. If you manually changed the grade,
        the standard scheme would not apply to this card for this exercise session.</string>
    <string name="article_question_display_paragraph_1">You can turn off the question display. In
        this case, it is supposed that you will get the question via voice playback. This will help
        improve your listening skills when learning a foreign language. Together with this, it is
        appropriate to enable the automatic pronunciation of the question. If you still want to see
        the question, just click on \'Show question\'.</string>

        marked as incorrect. If you have set enough time to respond, then the reason for expiring
        the card is that you have lost concentration, and the motivational timer will act as a

    <string name="article_pronunciation">This app supports the pronunciation of text
        through Text-to-speech API provided by Android OS. For each deck, you can choose the
        language in which to pronounce the question, and the language in which to pronounce the
        answer. Therefore, it is important to use one language for questions and one language for
        answers when creating a deck. If you want to have cards with different languages of
        questions and answers, then you need to create separate decks. It is recommended to always
        indicate languages.

        \n\nYou can also choose to automatically pronounce the question or answer. This is always
        useful when learning languages.

        \n\nIf \'Speak text in brackets\' is disabled, then the application will not speak the text
        framed in brackets () {} [] &lt;&gt;. So you can add any additional information in brackets,
        for example, transcription of words, synonyms, words with which you often confuse
        translation.

        \n\nTo pronounce some part of the text, just highlight it and click the pronunciation
        icon.</string>
    <string name="article_walking_mode">\'Walking mode\' is a special mode of exercise where you
        can answer questions without looking at the screen. Control is carried out using
        <annotation clickable="walking_mode_settings">gestures of the volume buttons</annotation>.
        Each action is accompanied with pronunciation, for example, when you go to the next card,
        a question will be pronounced, when you answer (remember/not remember), the answer will be
        pronounced.

        \n\nThis mode can be used when you walk to somewhere and you want to make good use of time.
        That\'s where it got its name from.

        \n\n⚠️ Precautions:

        \n\n- the screen must be keep on. This is due to the Android operating system: applications
        can use the volume keys only when it is in the foreground.

        \n\n- Methods \'Testing with variants\' and \'Spell check\' are inappropriate to
        use in this mode and therefore forcibly switch to the \'Self testing\'.

        \n\n- auto-pronunciation of questions and answers is turned on. Don\'t forget to specify
        the correct languages ​​in the deck pronunciation settings.

        \n\n- \'Motivational timer\' is turned off.</string>
    <string name="article_autoplaying_cards">Autoplaying cards is a mode in which questions and
        answers are pronounced in turn. It can be compared to an audio player, but instead of
        tracks, questions and answers are played. This mode is suitable when you are doing
        something, but could listen simultaneously, for example, when preparing food.

        \n\nFor each deck, you can customize the pronunciation plan. For example, to pronounce a
        question twice, or to increase the interval between question and answer so that you have
        enough time to remember the answer before you hear it.</string>
    <string name="article_presets">Preset is a set of controls created in advance that can be
        reused. Presets are needed to avoid the routine of settings decks.

        \n\nWhat preset names mean:

        \n\n\tDefault - standard unchangeable settings.

        \n\n\tIndividual - no preset is applied.

        \n\n\t\'Your preset name\' - a saved preset that can be shared. Any change of this preset
        will affect each deck to which it is applied.</string>
    <string name="article_advice_on_compiling_deck">1. Try to keep your cards as short as possible.
        It is better to create several than to put everything into one. For example, if you create
        a card for memorizing a foreign word, then it should describe only one interpretation of
        it, which can be expressed in no more than 3 words. You can add additional information in
        parentheses, but the answer itself should be short.

        \n\n2. Create decks taking into account the settings that you are going to apply to them.

        \n\n\t- For testing method \'Testing with variants\', variants are taken from the same
        deck. Therefore, the cards should contain answers that fit to be variants.

        \n\n\t- In the pronunciation settings of a deck, you can specify a language for questions
        and another language for answers. Therefore, you need to create deck where one language is
        used for questions, and also one language is used for answers.

        \n\n\t- If you want to use \'Card inversion\', then create such a card so that an answer can
        look like a question.

        \n\n3. If you are creating the deck as a file on your computer, you can download
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pfAZ6tCgNMwCfXnc-F7-Fi5f8_W5eDXT/view?usp=sharing">this template file</a>.
        All you need to do is replace \'question\' with your question and \'answer\' with your
        answer. Use Copy/Paste to speed up composing. If you are creating a deck on a device, try
        to use multi-window mode.

        \n\n4. Think of the deck compiling as part of the learning process. Try to remember
        everything on the fly.</string>
    <string name="article_advice_on_studying">1. Don\'t memorize an answer word for word. The main
        thing is that you have an understanding of the answer. Always visualize the question being
        asked.

        \n\n2. If you are learning a foreign language, speak answers aloud. This will help you not
        only to pronounce words correctly, but also to focus on your studies.

        \n\n3. Use tools that help you focus on your studies. Use
        <annotation clickable="motivational_timer">\'Motivational timer\'</annotation>, turn on
        full screen mode, activate the \'Do not disturb\' mode in the device settings.

        \n\n4. If the question is bad for you to remember, edit the card, rephrase the question,
        remove the unnecessary in the answer. If you got the answers mixed up, use the search and
        find the confusing card.

        \n\n5. Make it a rule that once a day you should not have any tasks left to study.</string>

    <string name="developer_story">More than a year ago, when I started learning a foreign
        language, I decided to use flashcards to memorize words. Having tried dozens of different
        apps on Google Play, none of them satisfied me completely. So I decided to create my own
        one.

        \n\nFirst of all, I wanted my application to have a clean UI so that I could fully focus
        on my studies. My app had to be convenient and super fast so that I could repeat at least
        10 words per minute. Also, my requirements included support for spaced repetitions,
        pronunciation, importing cards from a file (because a deck can created on a computer quite
        quickly using copy-paste).

        \n\nAfter implementing the pronunciation, I realized that with this, I can greatly expand
        the possibilities of the learning process. First, I can hide the text of the question to
        perceive the text not visually, but aurally. It would be a good contributor to improving my
        listening skills. Second, during some activities, I could repeat the material at the same
        time, if the application could switch cards itself. Third, (it\'s somewhat unusual function)
        I could answer the questions when I walk somewhere, not looking at the screen by
        controlling the application with the volume buttons. Well it\'s done.

        \n\nFurthermore, I implemented some simple but important features, for example, editing card
        on the go, card reversing, reusing deck settings and many others. There are also additional
        options to help you focus on your studies, such as \'Full Screen Mode\' and \'Motivational
        timer\'.

        \n\nAm I satisfied with the program now? Not exactly. There are a few more ideas for
        improvement. But I think that at this stage it looks quite attractive and can suit many
        people who study languages and not only.

        \n\nI am not in any way pursuing commercial goals. My app is completely free and open
        source. I\'d like to know what you think about my app!</string>
